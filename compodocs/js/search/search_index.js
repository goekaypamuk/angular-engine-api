It facilitates the usage and handles the synchronization.\nThe Qlik Engine API is a WebSocket protocol that uses JSON to pass information between the Qlik Sense engine and the clients. The Qlik Engine API consists of a set of objects representing apps, lists, and so on. These objects are organized in a hierarchical structure. When you send requests to the API, you perform actions on these objects.\nThe Qlik Engine API can be used for:\n\ncreating apps and loading data\nbuilding stories\ngetting system information\n\nTypical situations where you would use the Qlik Engine API include:\n\nbuilding a specialized client as a standalone or web application\nautomating repetitive or complicated updates or changes to apps\n\nTo work with the Qlik Engine API, you can use any language or tool that supports WebSockets and can parse JSON. JavaScript is a common and obvious choice, because of its built-in JSON support, and because there are a number of libraries available to make it easier to work with WebSockets.\nQlik Classes\n\nUse Global class methods\nUse Doc class methods\nUse Bookmark class methods\nUse Field class methods\n\nInstallation\nTo install this library, run:\n$ npm install angular-qlik-api -saveConsuming AngularQlikApi library\nOnce you have published your library to npm, you can import your library in any Angular application by running:\n$ npm install angular-qlik-apiand then from your Angular AppModule:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n\n// Import AngularQlikApiModule library\nimport {AngularQlikApiModule, QlikConfig} from 'angular-qlik-api';\n\n// Define your connection to Qlik Sense Server or Qlik Sense Desktop\nconst qlikConfig = new QlikConfig({\n  useWss: false,\n  address: 'localhost',\n  port: 4848\n});\n\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    // Specify  library as an import\n    AngularQlikApiModule.forRoot(qlikConfig)\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Once the library is imported, you can use its components and services in your Angular application:\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root'\n})\nexport class MyApp implements OnDestroy {\n  myHyperCube: HyperCube;\n  constructor(qlikGlobal: QlikGlobalService ) {\n    this.myHyperCube = this.qlikGlobal.openDoc('sales discovery.qvf')\n         .createHyperCube()\n         .addDimension(new Dimension('Region Name'))\n         .addMeasure(new Measure('Sum([YTD Sales Amount])'))\n         .subscribe( reply => {\n            console.log(reply);\n         });\n  }\n\n  ngOnDestroy() {\n    this.myHyperCube.unsubscribe();\n  }\n}Development Progress\n\n[x] Global Class Methods\n[x] App Class Methods\n[x] GenericBookmark Methods\n[ ] GenericDimension Class Methods\n[ ] GenericObject Class Methods\n[ ] GenericMeasure Class Methods\n[ ] GenericDimension Class Methods\n[ ] GenericVariable Class Methods\n[x] Field Class Methods\n[ ] Variable Class Methods\n\nInitially, a hypercube builder has been added to the library but it may change completely in future releases!\nDevelopment\nTo generate all *.js, *.d.ts and *.metadata.json files:\n$ npm run buildTo lint all *.ts files:\n$ npm run lintContribution\nThis library is still under cunstruction and we are looking for contributors. \nIf you like to contribute plase contact me: goekaypamuk@gmai.com\nLicense\nMIT © Gökay Pamuk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 goekaypamuk\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
